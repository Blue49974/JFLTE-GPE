# JFLTE-GPE
This is the Google Play Edition ROM for the jflte device tree, including jfltexx, jfltetmo, jflteatt and jfltespr

# How-To

You can build for either Windows or Linux (preferred) easily by using the supplied tools. 

Building for Linux is the preferred and recommended method, as this allows you to build the kernel with the ROM if you require, and it is easier for me to maintain as I use Linux primarily (almost exclusively). Going forward, the Windows building method will just build a ROM with whatever is on the repo. If you want the latest features, [fire up a VM](http://www.wikihow.com/Install-Ubuntu-on-VirtualBox) and use Linux.

To do that follow the [Linux building instructions](docs/LINUX.md).

Or, follow the [Windows building instructions](docs/WINDOWS.md).
